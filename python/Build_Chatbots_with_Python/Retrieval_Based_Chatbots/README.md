Retrieval-based chatbots are the most popular chatbot implementation in use today.

This popularity is due in large part to the strength of retrieval-based bots in closed-domain conversations â€” conversations that are clearly limited in scope.

A retrieval-based chatbots cannot generalize conversation (even with lots and lots of data) or generate anything new.

Most chatbot systems depend on three main tasks in order to convincingly complete a conversation:
## 1. Intent Classification:
When presented with user input, a system must classify the intent of the message. 
## 2. Entity Recognition:
 Entities are often the proper nouns of a message, like the day of the week when an item will ship, or the name of a specific item of clothing. A chatbot system must be able to recognize which entities a user message revolves around, and reference those entities in a response.
## 3. Response Selection:
Retrieval-based chatbot systems are unique in their reliance on a collection of predefined responses to user messages. Once a system has an understanding of both the intent and main entities of the user message, the program can retrieve the best-fit response from this collection.
