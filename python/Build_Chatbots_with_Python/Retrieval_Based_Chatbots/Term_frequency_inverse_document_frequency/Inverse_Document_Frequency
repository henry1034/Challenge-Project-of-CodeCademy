#### TERM FREQUENCY–INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY
# [Inverse Document Frequency](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-chatbots-with-python/tracks/retrieval-based-chatbots/modules/language-and-topic-modeling-chatbots/lessons/language-model-tf-idf/exercises/inverse-document-frequency)
The inverse document frequency component of the tf-idf score penalizes terms that appear more frequently across a corpus.
The intuition is that words that appear more frequently in the corpus give less insight into the topic or meaning of an individual document, and should thus be deprioritized.

For example, terms like “the” or “go” are used all over the place, so in a bag-of-words model, they would be given priority even though they don’t provide much meaning; 
tf-idf would deprioritize these sorts of common words.
