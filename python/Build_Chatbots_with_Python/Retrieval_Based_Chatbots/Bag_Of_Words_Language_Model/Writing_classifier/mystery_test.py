My friend,
From the 10th of July to the 13th, a fierce storm raged, clouds of
freeing spray broke over the ship, incasing her in a coat of icy mail,
and the tempest forced all of the ice out of the lower end of the
channel and beyond as far as the eye could see, but the _Roosevelt_
still remained surrounded by ice.
Hope to see you soon.

Hi CSABA,

We’ve been notified that a parcel has been posted to you from SALUTICA ALLIED SOLUTIONS SDN BHD in Malaysia.

Just to let you know, it’s likely there will be a Customs charge to pay for this item, due to the declared value of it.

You don’t need to do anything now. We’ll let you know when it’s in the UK and confirm if any charges have been applied by Border Force.
