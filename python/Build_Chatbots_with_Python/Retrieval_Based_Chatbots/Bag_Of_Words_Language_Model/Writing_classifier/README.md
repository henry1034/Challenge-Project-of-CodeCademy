#### RETRIEVAL-BASED CHATBOTS
# [Mystery Friend](https://github.com/lendoo73/Challenge-Project-of-CodeCademy/tree/master/python/Build_Chatbots_with_Python/Retrieval_Based_Chatbots/Bag_Of_Words_Language_Model/Writing_classifier)
You’ve received an anonymous postcard from a friend who you haven’t seen in years. Your friend did not leave a name, but the card is definitely addressed to you. So far, you’ve narrowed your search down to three friends, based on handwriting:
* Emma Goldman
* Matthew Henson
* TingFang Wu

But which one sent you the card?

You can classify writing as related to one friend or another by building a kind of friend writing classifier. You have past writing from all three friends stored up in the variable friends_docs, which means you can use scikit-learn’s bag-of-words and Naive Bayes classifier to determine who the mystery friend is!
