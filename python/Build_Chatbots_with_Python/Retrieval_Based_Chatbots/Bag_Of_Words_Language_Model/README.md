Bag-of-words (BoW) is a statistical language model based on word count.

## Statistical language model
A **statistical language model** is a way for computers to make sense of language based on probability.
A statistical language model focused on the starting letter for words.

A **different statistical model** that pays attention to word order might tell us that the word “fish” tends to follow the word “fantastic.”

**Bag-of-words** does not give a flying fish about word starts or word order though; its sole concern is **word count** — how many times each word appears in a document.

**Unigram model**: a special case of another statistical model, the n-gram model, with n (the number of words in a sequence) set to 1
