#### BAG-OF-WORDS LANGUAGE MODEL

One of the most common ways to implement the BoW model in Python is as a dictionary with each key set to a word and each value set to the number of times that word appears.

The words from the sentence go into the bag-of-words and come out as a dictionary of words with their corresponding counts. For statistical models, we call the text that we use to build the model our ***training data***. Usually, we need to prepare our text data by breaking it up into documents (shorter strings of text, generally sentences).
