#### RETRIEVAL-BASED CHATBOTS
# [Cyborg Cantina](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-chatbots-with-python/tracks/retrieval-based-chatbots/modules/retrieval-based-chatbots/projects/chatbots-retrieval-cyborg-cantina)
Retrieval-based chatbots are commonly used in customer service environments. User questions are constrained to the specific service being provided, which approximates a closed-domain conversation. However, people are known to be especially picky with their food. Can you create a chatbot system that effectively answers all of a diner’s questions about the food on a restaurant menu?

In this project you will build a retrieval-based chatbot system for a restaurant serving Mexican cuisine. You’ll use a combination of tf-idf scoring, word embedding models, and a set of use-defined functions in order to answer any number of questions from a restaurant diner.

By the end of this project, you’ll have constructed a full retrieval-based chatbot system, conversed with your own chatbot creation, and improved the system by adding additional candidate responses!
