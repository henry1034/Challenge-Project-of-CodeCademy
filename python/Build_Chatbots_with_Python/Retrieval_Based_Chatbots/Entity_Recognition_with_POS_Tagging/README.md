After determining the best method for the classification of a user’s intent, chatbot architects set upon the task of recognizing entities within a user’s message.
There are a number of methods that can be used to locate and interpret the entities found in a user message — it is up to the system architect (you!) to critically evaluate methods and select those that are best-fit for a chatbot’s specific domain.

**Part of speech (POS)** tagging is commonly used to identify entities within a user message, as most entities are nouns.
