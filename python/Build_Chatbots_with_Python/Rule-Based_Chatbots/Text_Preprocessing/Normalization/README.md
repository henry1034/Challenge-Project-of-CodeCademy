#### TEXT PREPROCESSING
# Normalization
Some data may require further processing through text normalization. Text ***normalization*** is a catch-all term for various text pre-processing tasks.
Example:
* Upper or lowercasing
* Stopword removal
* Stemming – bluntly removing prefixes and suffixes from a word
* Lemmatization – replacing a single-word token with its root
