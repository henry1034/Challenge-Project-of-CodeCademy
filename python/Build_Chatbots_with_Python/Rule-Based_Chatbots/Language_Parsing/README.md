Automate the part-of-speech tagging process with `nltk`â€˜s `pos_tag()` function:
* the function takes one argument, a list of words in the order they appear in a sentence,
* returns a list of tuples, where the first entry in the tuple is a word and the second is the part-of-speech tag.

```
from nltk import pos_tag

word_sentence = ['do', 'you', 'suppose', 'oz', 'could', 'give', 'me', 'a', 'heart', '?']

part_of_speech_tagged_sentence = pos_tag(word_sentence)
```
Abbreviations are given instead of the full part of speech name.
```
[
('do', 'VB'), 
('you', 'PRP'), 
('suppose', 'VB'), 
('oz', 'NNS'), 
('could', 'MD'), 
('give', 'VB'), 
('me', 'PRP'), 
('a', 'DT'), 
('heart', 'NN'), 
('?', '.')
]
```
