#### LEARN STATISTICS WITH PYTHON
# [Healthcare in Different States](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-statistics-with-python/projects/healthcare-in-different-states)

In this project, we will use boxplots to investigate the way hospitals in different states across the United States charge their patients for medical procedures.

The data originally came from the [United State Health and Human Services Department](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Inpatient/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3).

Letâ€™s use boxplots to find more meaning in this data!
