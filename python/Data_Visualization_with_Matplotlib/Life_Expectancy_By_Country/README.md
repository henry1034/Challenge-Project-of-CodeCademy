#### STATISTICS FOR DATA ANALYSIS
# <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/paths/analyze-data-with-python/tracks/ida-6-statistics-for-data-analysis/modules/ida-6-2-quartiles-quantiles/projects/life-expectancy-by-country" target="_blank">Life Expectancy By Country</a>
Over the course of the past few centuries, technological and medical advancements have helped increase the life expectancy of humans. However, as of now, the average life expectancy of humans varies depending on what country you live in.

In this project, we will investigate a dataset containing information about the average life expectancy in 158 different countries. We will specifically look at how a country’s economic success might impact the life expectancy in that area.
------------
1. <p>We’ve imported a dataset containing the life expectancy in different countries. The data can be found in the variable named <code>data</code>.</p><p>To begin, let’s get a sense of what this data looks like. Print <code>data.head()</code> to see the first 5 rows of the dataset.</p><p>Look at the names of the columns. What other pieces of information does this dataset contain?</p><p>You may want to comment out this print statement after looking at the data.</p>
2. <p>Let’s isolate the column that contains the life expectancy and store it in a variable named <code>life_expectancy</code>. To get a single column from a Panda DataFrame, use this syntax:<br /><code>single_column = dataFrameName["columnName"]</code></p><p>Make sure to pay attention to capitalization and spaces when using the column name!</p>
3. <p>We can now use NumPy functions on that column! Let’s use the <code>np.quantile()</code> function to find the quartiles of <code>life_expectancy</code>. Store the result in a variable named <code>life_expectancy_quartiles</code> and print the results.</p>
