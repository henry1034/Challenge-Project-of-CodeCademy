#### Learn about what probability is and the language we use to represent it!

## Probability

Probability is ***a branch of mathematics that allows us to quantify uncertainty***. 
In our daily lives, we often use probability to make decisions, even without thinking about it!

For example, many weather reports give a percent chance that it will rain. 
If we hear that there is an 80 percent chance of rain, we probably are not going to make many plans outside. 
However, if there is only a 5 percent chance of rain, we may feel comfortable planning a picnic.

In this article, we are going to build a foundation for understanding probability. 
To do this, we are going to explore a field of mathematics called *set theory*.

## Set Theory

Set theory is a branch of mathematics based around the concept of sets. 
In simple terms, **a set is a collection of things**. 
For example, we can use a set to represent items in a backpack. 
We might have:
<h3 align="center">
{Book, Paper, Folder, Hat, Pen, Snack}
</h3>
Notationally, mathematicians often represent sets with curly braces. 
Sets also follow **two key rules**:
* Each element in a set is distinct.
* The elements in a set are in no particular order.

Therefore, we can say:
<h3 align="center">
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = {5, 3, 2, 4, 1}
</h3>
When defining a set, we often use a capital letter. 
For example:
<h3 align="center">
A = {1, 2 ,3 ,4 ,5}
</h3>
Sets can also contain subsets. 
Set A is a subset of set B if all the elements in A exist within B. 
For example:
<h3 align="center">
A = {1, 2, 3}
<br />
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
</h3>
