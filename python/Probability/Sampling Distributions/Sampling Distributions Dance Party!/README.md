# [Sampling Distributions Dance Party!](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/probability-mssp/projects/sampling-distributions-project)

Get your dancing shoes ready! You are a DJ trying to make sure you are ready for a big party. You don’t have time to go through all the songs you can work with. Instead, you want to make sure that any sample of 30 songs from your playlist will get the party started. To do this, you will use the power of sampling distributions!

The dataset we are using for this project can be found here. For simplicity, we have removed some unnecessary columns.

Note that a helper_function.py file is loaded for you in the workspace. This file contains functions that you will use throughout this project. A solution.py file is also loaded for you in the workspace, which contains solution code for this project. We highly recommend that you complete the project on your own without checking the solution, but feel free to take a look if you get stuck or want to check your answers when you’re done!
