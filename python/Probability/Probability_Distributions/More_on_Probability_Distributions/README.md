#### MORE ON PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

# [Introduction to the Poisson Distribution](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/probability-mssp/lessons/more-on-probability-distributions/exercises/introduction-to-the-poisson-distribution)

There are numerous probability distributions used to represent almost any random event. 
In the previous lesson, we learned about the 
**binomial distribution** to represent events like any number of *coin flips* as well as the 
**normal distribution** to represent events such as the *height of* a randomly selected *woman*.

The **Poisson distribution** is another common distribution, and it is used *to describe the number of times a certain event occurs* within a fixed time or space interval. 
For example, the Poisson distribution can be used to describe *the number of cars that pass through a specific intersection* between 4pm and 5pm on a given day. 
It can also be used to describe *the number of calls received in an office between 1pm to 3pm* on a certain day.

The Poisson distribution is defined by the **rate** parameter, symbolized by the Greek letter **lambda, λ**.

**Lambda** represents **the expected value — or the average value — of the distribution**. 
For example, if our expected number of customers between 1pm and 2pm is 7, then we would set the parameter for the Poisson distribution to be 7. 
The PMF for the Poisson(7) distribution is as follows:
