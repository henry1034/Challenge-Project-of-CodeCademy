Sorting the world into categories — classifying — is an important task you do every day.
Classifying is an important task within computer science as well.
Classification is a technique to predict to which class each instance or example belongs. 
Supervised classification learns the prediction model from the labeled data. 
In this lesson, we will talk about two types of classification:
1. **Binary classification** results in a decision that is yes or no.
2. **Multi-class classification** categorizes examples in one of several categories. 

Because neural networks are very effective for high-dimensionality problems and able to model complex relationships between variables, they are often used for classification tasks.
