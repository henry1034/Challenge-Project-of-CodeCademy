# [Deep Learning Regression with Admissions Data](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow/tracks/dlsp-getting-started-with-tensorflow/modules/dlsp-regression-challenge-project/projects/deep-learning-regression-with-admissions-data)

## Project Goals
For this project, you will attempt to determine which student factors (such as test scores) are most important when applying to graduate school.

By analyzing the parameters in this [graduate admissions dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv), you will use TensorFlow with Keras to create a regression model that can evaluate the chances of an applicant being admitted. You hope this will give you further insight into the graduate admissions world and improve your test prep strategy.
