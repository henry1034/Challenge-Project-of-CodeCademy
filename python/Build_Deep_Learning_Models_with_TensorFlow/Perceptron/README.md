Perceptrons are the building blocks of Neural Networks.

The perceptron is an artificial neuron that simulates the task of a biological neuron to solve problems through its own “sense” of the world.

The perceptron comes with its own artificial design and set of parameters, at its core, a single perceptron is trying to make a simple decision.

The perceptron can correct itself based on the result of its decision to make better decisions in the future!

If you combine a bunch of such perceptrons, you will get a neural network that can even make better decisions.

## [Representing a Perceptron](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow/tracks/dlsp-foundations-deep-learning-and-perceptrons/modules/perceptron/lessons/perceptron/exercises/represent-perceptron)

So the perceptron is an artificial neuron that can make a simple decision.

The perceptron has three main components:
* **inputs**: Each input corresponds to a feature. (age, height, weight, college degree...
* **weights**:
