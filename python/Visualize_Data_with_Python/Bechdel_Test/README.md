# [Bechdel Test](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/visualize-data-with-python/tracks/data-manipulation-in-python-dvp/modules/pandas-dvp/informationals/dvp-u4-bechdel-test)
Welcome to your next off-platform project “Next Bechdel”: Visualizing Race and Gender Representation In American Movies.

In this project you’ll use data visualization techniques to analyze how the top 50 movies of 2016 performed according to the [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) and other representation-based tests.

**The Bechdel-Wallace Test** — often abbreviated to the “Bechdel Test” — evaluates movies based on two simple questions:
1. Does the movie have at least two named female characters?
2. And do those characters have at least one conversation that is not about a man?

You will be completing this project on your own computer.
