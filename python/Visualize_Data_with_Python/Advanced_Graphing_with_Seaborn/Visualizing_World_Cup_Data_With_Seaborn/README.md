For this project you will be exploring data from the [Fifa World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup) from 1930-2014 to analyze trends and discover insights about the world’s game, fútbol!

This Fifa World Cup data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup). Kaggle is a platform for data science competitions that hosts many datasets online.

Using Seaborn you will create a series of plots that explore aggregates and distribution across the goals scored in World Cup games.
