#### [INTRODUCTION TO REGULAR EXPRESSIONS](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/practical-data-cleaning/lessons/nlp-regex-conceptual/exercises/introduction)

A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that describe a pattern of text that should be found, or matched, in a string or document. 
By matching text, we can identify how often and where certain pieces of text occur, as well as have the opportunity to replace or update these pieces of text if needed.

## [Literals](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/practical-data-cleaning/lessons/nlp-regex-conceptual/exercises/literals)
The simplest text we can match with regular expressions are ***literals***. 
This is where our regular expression contains the exact text that we want to match.  
The regex  
`bananas` will match the text `bananas`.

## [Alternation](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/practical-data-cleaning/lessons/nlp-regex-conceptual/exercises/alternation)
Alternation, performed in regular expressions with the pipe symbol, `|`, allows us to match either the characters preceding the `|` OR the characters after the `|`.  
The regex  
`baboons|gorillas` will match `baboons` in the text `I love baboons`, but will also match `gorillas` in the text `I love gorillas`.

## [Character Sets](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/practical-data-cleaning/lessons/nlp-regex-conceptual/exercises/character-sets)
**Character sets**, denoted by a pair of brackets `[]`, let us match one character from a series of characters, allowing for matches with incorrect or different spellings.  
The regex  
`con[sc]en[sc]us` will match `consensus`, the correct spelling of the word, but also match the following three incorrect spellings: `concensus`, `consencus`, and `concencus`.

The letters inside the first brackets, `s` and `c`, are the different possibilities for the character that comes after `con` and before `en`. 
Similarly for the second brackets, `s` and `c` are the different character possibilities to come after `en` and before `us`.

The regex  
`[cat]` will match the characters `c`, `a`, or `t`, but not the text `cat`.

We can make our character sets even more powerful with the help of the caret `^` symbol. 
Placed at the front of a character set, the `^` negates the set, matching any character that is not stated.
These are called ***negated character sets***.

The regex `[^cat]` will match any character that is not `c`, `a`, or `t`.

## [Wild for Wildcards](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/practical-data-cleaning/lessons/nlp-regex-conceptual/exercises/wildcards)
**Wildcards** will match any single character (letter, number, symbol or whitespace) in a piece of text. 
They are useful when we do not care about the specific value of a character, but only that a character exists!

Let’s say we want to match any 9-character piece of text. 
The regex `.........` will completely match `orangutan` and `marsupial`!

The regex `I ate . bananas` will completely match both `I ate 3 bananas` and `I ate 8 bananas`!

What happens if we want to match an actual period, `.`? 
We can use the escape character, `\`, to escape the wildcard functionality of the `.` and match an actual period. 
The regex `Howler monkeys are really lazy\.` will completely match the text `Howler monkeys are really lazy.`.

## [Ranges](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/practical-data-cleaning/lessons/nlp-regex-conceptual/exercises/ranges)
Ranges allow us to specify a range of characters in which we can make a match without having to type out each individual character.

The regex `[abc]`, which would match any character `a`, `b`, or `c`, is equivalent to regex range `[a-c]`.

The `-` character allows us to specify that we are interested in matching a range of characters.

The regex  
`I adopted [2-9] [b-h]ats` will match the text `I adopted 4 bats` as well as `I adopted 8 cats` and even `I adopted 5 hats`.

With ranges we can match any single *capital letter* with the regex `[A-Z]`, *lowercase letter* with the regex `[a-z]`, any *digit* with the regex `[0-9]`.

We can even have multiple ranges in the same character set! 
To match *any single capital or lowercase alphabetical character*, we can use the regex `[A-Za-z]`.

Within any character set `[]` we **only match one character**.

## [Shorthand Character Classes](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/practical-data-cleaning/lessons/nlp-regex-conceptual/exercises/shorthand-character-classes)
**Shorthand character classes** represent common ranges, and they make writing regular expressions much simpler.

* `\w`: the “word character” class represents the regex range `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, and it matches a single *uppercase character, lowercase character, digit or underscore*
* `\d`: the “digit character” class represents the regex range `[0-9]`, and it matches a single *digit* character
* `\s`: the “whitespace character” class represents the regex range `[ \t\r\n\f\v]`, matching a single *space, tab, carriage return, line break, form feed, or vertical tab*

The regex  
`\d\s\w\w\w\w\w\w\w` matches a digit character, followed by a whitespace character, followed by 7 word characters. 
Thus the regex completely matches the text `3 monkeys`.

In addition to the shorthand character classes `\w`, `\d`, and `\s`, we also have access to the negated shorthand character classes! 
These shorthands will match any character that is NOT in the regular shorthand classes. 
These negated shorthand classes include:
* `\W`: the “non-word character” class represents the regex range `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\w`
* `\D`: the “non-digit character” class represents the regex range `[^0-9]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\d`
* `\S`: the “non-whitespace character” class represents the regex range `[^ \t\r\n\f\v]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\s`

## [Grouping](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/practical-data-cleaning/lessons/nlp-regex-conceptual/exercises/grouping)
We were able to match either `baboons` or `gorillas` using the regex `baboons|gorillas`, taking advantage of the `|` symbol.

But what if we want to match the whole piece of text `I love baboons` and `I love gorillas` with the same regex? 
The regex  
`I love baboons|gorillas` would completely match the string `I love baboons`, would **not match `I love gorillas`**, and would instead match `gorillas`. 
This is because the `|` symbol matches the entire expression before or after itself.

**Grouping**, denoted with the open parenthesis `(` and the closing parenthesis `)`, lets us group parts of a regular expression together, and allows us to limit alternation to part of the regex.

The regex `I love (baboons|gorillas)` will match the text `I love` and then match either `baboons` or `gorillas`, as the grouping limits the reach of the `|` to the text within the parentheses.

These groups are also called ***capture groups***, as they have the power to select, or capture, a substring from our matched text.

## [Quantifiers - Fixed](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/practical-data-cleaning/lessons/nlp-regex-conceptual/exercises/quantifiers-fixed)
**Fixed quantifiers**, denoted with curly braces `{}`, let us indicate the exact quantity of a character we wish to match, or allow us to provide a quantity range to match on.
* `\w{3}` will match exactly 3 word characters
* `\w{4,7}` will match at minimum 4 word characters and at maximum 7 word characters

The regex  
`roa{3}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by 3 `a`s, and then the character `r`, such `a`s in the text `roaaar`. 
The regex  
`roa{3,7}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by at least 3 `a`s and at most 7 `a`s, followed by an `r`, matching the strings `roaaar`, `roaaaaar` and `roaaaaaaar`.

Quantifiers are considered to be ***greedy***.  
This means that they will match the greatest quantity of characters they possibly can.  
The regex  
`mo{2,4}` will match the text `moooo` in the string `moooo`, and not return a match of `moo`, or `mooo`. 
This is because the fixed quantifier wants to match the largest number of `o`s as possible, which is 4 in the string `moooo`.
