#### TREES: PYTHON

# [Trees Introduction](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/complex-data-structures/lessons/learn-trees-les/exercises/trees-intro)

Before we start building (planting?) our trees, let’s do a quick inventory of what we’ll need in our Python implementation. 
We’re going to make the class `TreeNodes`.

`TreeNodes`:
* have a value
* have a reference to zero or more other `TreeNodes`
* can add a node as a child
* can remove a child
* can traverse (or travel through) connected nodes
