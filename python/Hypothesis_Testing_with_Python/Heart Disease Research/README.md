# [Heart Disease Research Part I](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/hypothesis-testing-python/projects/heart-disease-research-i)

In this project, youâ€™ll investigate some data from a sample patients who were evaluated for heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. 
The data was downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
and then cleaned for analysis. 
The principal investigators responsible for data collection were:
1. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
2. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
3. University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
