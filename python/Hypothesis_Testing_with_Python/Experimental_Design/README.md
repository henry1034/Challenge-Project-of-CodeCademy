Learn how to choose an appropriate hypothesis test for your data and questions.

## Introduction

In this module we’ll cover some of the key considerations for designing an experiment. 
One of the first things to consider is which statistical test is appropriate for the question you are trying to answer.

There are many different types of hypothesis tests that should be used in different situations. 
In this article, we are going to briefly review some of them and when they are appropriate.

Here is a summary table of some of the hypothesis tests we’ll cover:
