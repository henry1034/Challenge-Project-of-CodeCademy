#### TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS: WHITEBOARDING

# [Introduction](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/technical-interview-practice-python/lessons/technical-interview-wb/exercises/technical-interview-wb-intro)

Aspiring developers must pass a technical interview to be hired as a professional. 
These interviews evaluate the candidateâ€™s ability to write code, articulate their thought process, and problem solve in a timed environment.

Technical interviews take many forms: 
writing code alongside an employee of the company, 
testing online with a third-party service, 
take-home challenges spanning several days, 
and more!

A whiteboarding technical interview requires the interviewee to plan and code the solution by hand. 
The candidate relies on their ability to communicate without the assistance of a text editor or web browser.

This lesson covers strategies to improve performance in a whiteboarding interview. 
Each exercise features a step in the interview with a video demonstration of the technique.

The steps are:
1. **Clarify** the Problem
2. Create **Inputs**
3. **Outline** the Solution
4. **Code** the Solution
5. **Test** the Solution
6. **Analyze** the Solution
