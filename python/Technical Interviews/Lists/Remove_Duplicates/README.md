#### TECHNICAL INTERVIEW PROBLEMS IN PYTHON: LISTS

# [Remove Duplicates: Naive](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/technical-interview-practice-python/lessons/tip-python-lists/exercises/tip-python-lists-duplicates-space)

Given a list of values with duplicates, return a list holding the same values in the same order with all duplicates removed.
```python
duplicates = ['a', 'a', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'g', 't', 't']
remove_dups(duplicates)
# ['a', 'x', 'g', 't']
 
more_duplicates = [3, 3, 1, 7, 7, 7]
remove_dups(more_duplicates)
# [3, 1, 7]
```
This is a great problem because there are many different ways to solve it. 
Questions with multiple solutions are an opportunity to discuss with the interviewer.

Remember: the ability to communicate is essential!

## Clarifying Questions:

### Are there constraints on time or space efficiency?

No! Any solution will do.

### Is it okay to alter the input list?

You can alter the list or return a new list.
