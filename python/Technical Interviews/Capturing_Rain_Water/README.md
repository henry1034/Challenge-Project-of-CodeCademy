#### TECHNICAL INTERVIEW PRACTICE WITH PYTHON

# [Capturing Rain Water](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/technical-interview-practice-python/projects/rain-water)

A histogram is a chart which consists of a series of bars. 
A Python list can represent a histogram by containing integers, each of which represents the height of a single bar.

The list `[4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2]` would represent the following histogram:

![histogram without water](histogram_v1.svg)

For our problem, imagine that rainwater has fallen over the histogram and collected between the bars. 
Hereâ€™s how the previous histogram would look filled with water:

![histogram with water](histogram_v2.svg)
We need to write a function which calculates the total water captured from an input of a list of integers.

Our function would return 6 from the previous example.
