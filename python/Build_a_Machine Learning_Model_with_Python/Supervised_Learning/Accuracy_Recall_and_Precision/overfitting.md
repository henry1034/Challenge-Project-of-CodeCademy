Learn about how to recognize when your model is fitting too closely to the training data.

Often in Machine Learning, we feed a huge amount of data to an algorithm that then learns how to classify that input based on rules it creates. 
The data we feed into this algorithm, the training data, is hugely important. 
The rules created by the program will be determined by looking at every example in the training data.

Overfitting occurs when we have fit our modelâ€™s parameters too closely to the training data:
