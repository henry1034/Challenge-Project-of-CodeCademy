A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a powerful supervised machine learning model used for classification. 
An SVM makes classifications by defining a decision boundary and then seeing what side of the boundary an unclassified point falls on. 
In the next few exercises, we’ll learn how these decision boundaries get defined, but for now, know that they’re defined by using a training set of classified points. 
That’s why SVMs are supervised machine learning models.

Decision boundaries are easiest to wrap your head around when the data has two features. 
In this case, the decision boundary is a line.
