# Bayes' Theorem

## [Introduction to Bayes' Theorem](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/machine-learning/tracks/advanced-supervised-learning-skill-path/modules/naive-bayes-classifier-skill-path/lessons/bayes-theorem/exercises/intro)

Bayesâ€™ Theorem is the basis of a branch of statistics called Bayesian Statistics, where we take prior knowledge into account before calculating new probabilities.

This allows us to find narrow solutions from a huge universe of possibilities.
British mathematician Alan Turing used it to crack the German Enigma code during WWII.
And now it is used in:
* Machine Learning
* Statistical Modeling
* A/B Testing
* Robotics
