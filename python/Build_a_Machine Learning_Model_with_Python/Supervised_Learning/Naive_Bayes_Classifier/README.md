# [The Naive Bayes Classifier](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/machine-learning/tracks/advanced-supervised-learning-skill-path/modules/naive-bayes-classifier-skill-path/lessons/naive-bayes-classifier/exercises/naive-bayes)

A Naive Bayes classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm that leverages Bayes’ Theorem to make predictions and classifications. 
Recall Bayes’ Theorem:
