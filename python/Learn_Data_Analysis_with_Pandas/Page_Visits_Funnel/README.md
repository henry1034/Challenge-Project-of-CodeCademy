#### LEARN DATA ANALYSIS WITH PANDAS

# [Page Visits Funnel](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/data-processing-pandas/projects/multi-tables-proj)

Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:

A user visits CoolTShirts.com
A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
A user clicks “checkout”
A user actually purchases a t-shirt
If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced developer work through it, click “Get Unstuck“ to see a project walkthrough video.
