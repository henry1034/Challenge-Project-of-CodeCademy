# [Visualizing Tech Stocks](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/finance-python/tracks/visualizing-finance-data/modules/visualizing-tech-stocks/informationals/visualizing-tech-stocks)
In this project you will analyze and visualize the top 5 highest valued technology stocks, as of the end of the first half of 2019: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

Using Pandas, Pandas-Datarader, and Matplotlib, you will take a visual look into the similarities and differences between these stocks during the six month period from January through June 2019. In your analysis you will perform the following:
1. Visualize the stock prices using matplotlib
2. Calculate and visualize the daily simple rate of return
3. Calculate and visualize the mean rates of return
4. Calculate and visualize the variances of the returns
5. Calculate and visualize the standard deviations of the returns
6. Write a short thesis based on the correlations between the tech stocks

To complete this project, you will be working in a Jupyter Notebook.
