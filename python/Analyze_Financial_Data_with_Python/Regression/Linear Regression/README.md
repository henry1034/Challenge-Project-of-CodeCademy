# [Points and Lines](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/finance-python/tracks/regression-for-finance/modules/linear-regression-python-finance/lessons/linear-regression/exercises/points-and-lines)
A line is determined by its slope and its intercept.

m: the slope
b: the intercept
y: a given point on the y-axis, and it corresponds to a given `x` on the x-axis

The slope is a measure of how steep the line is, while the intercept is a measure of where the line hits the y-axis.
When we perform Linear Regression, the goal is to get the “best” m and b for our data.
