# [Real Estate Investment Trust Analysis](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/finance-python/tracks/introduction-to-numpy-for-finance/modules/real-estate-investment-trust-analysis/informationals/real-estate-investment-trust-analysis)

In this project, you will analyze Real Estate Investment Trusts, commonly known as REITs. REITs are companies that own or operate real estate that produces income. REITs, like the stocks of regular public companies, are traded on different stock exchanges. Investing in a REIT allows you to invest in portfolios of real estate assets the same way you can invest in a company by buying its stock.

Using financial statistics and NumPy you will analyze two REITs: Sabra Health Care REIT Inc. (NASDAQ: SBRA), which invests in health care real estate, and Equity Residential (NASDAQ:EQR), which invests in rental apartment properties.
