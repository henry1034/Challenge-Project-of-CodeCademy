Before leaving for vacation, your colleague Mariel tasked you the with watering the plant on her desk. 
But of course, you forgot and the plant withered and nearly died. Oh no…

Build a device that keeps tabs on your plant’s health using the Circuit Playground Express.

Your device should have sensors that accurately measure:
* The temperature
* The amount of light
* The amount of water in the soil (optional)

Get live updates that help you grow the healthiest, happiest plant friends ever.
