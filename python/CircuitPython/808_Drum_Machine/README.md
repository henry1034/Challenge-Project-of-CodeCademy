# [808 Drum Machine](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-circuitpython/projects/circuit-playground-drum-machine)

The [Roland TR-808 drum machine](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/3/15162488/roland-tr-808-music-drum-machine-revolutionized-music) 
was introduced by the Roland Corporation in 1980 and discontinued in 1983. 
Even though it was a commercial disaster, it eventually changed music forever. 
Let’s build a little Circuit Playground Express tribute to the venerable 808!

Instead of a full-blown drum pattern sequencer, we’ll just focus on the machine’s pads which are used for finger drumming to play back sampled drum sounds.

We can use the capacitive touch pads on the Circuit Playground Express as triggers, and small .wav files for our drum sounds!
