#### LEARN THE BASICS OF MACHINE LEARNING
# [Predicting Income with Random Forests](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/machine-learning/projects/ranodm-forest-income)

In this project, we will be using a dataset containing census information from [UCIâ€™s Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census%20income).

By using this census data with a random forest, we will try to predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000.
