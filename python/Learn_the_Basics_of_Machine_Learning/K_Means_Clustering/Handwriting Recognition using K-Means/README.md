# [Handwriting Recognition using K-Means](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/machine-learning/projects/clustering)

The [U.S. Postal Service](https://www.govexec.com/federal-news/1999/02/postal-service-tests-handwriting-recognition-system/1746/)
has been using machine learning and scanning technologies since 1999. 
Because its postal offices have to look at roughly half a billion pieces of mail every day, they have done extensive research and developed very efficient algorithms for reading and understanding addresses. 
And not only the post office:
* ATMs can recognize handwritten bank checks
* Evernote can recognize handwritten task lists
* Expensify can recognize handwritten receipts

But how do they do it?

In this project, you will be using **K-means clustering** (the algorithm behind this magic) and scikit-learn to cluster images of handwritten digits.
