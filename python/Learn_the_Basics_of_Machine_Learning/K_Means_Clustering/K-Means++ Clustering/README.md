# K-Means++ Clusterin

## [Introduction to K-Means++](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/machine-learning/lessons/machine-learning-k-means-plus-plus/exercises/introduction)

The K-Means clustering algorithm is the most popular clustering algorithm for Machine Learning.

However, there can be some problems with its first step. 
In the traditional K-Means algorithms, the starting postitions of the centroids are intialized completely randomly.
This can result in suboptimal clusters.

K-Means++ changes the way centroids are initalized to try to fix this problem.

Suppose we have four data samples that form a rectangle whose width is greater than its height:
