# K-Means Clustering

## [Introduction to Clustering](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/machine-learning/lessons/machine-learning-clustering/exercises/introduction)

Often, the data you encounter in the real world won’t have flags attached and won’t provide labeled answers to your question. 
Finding patterns in this type of data, unlabeled data, is a common theme in many machine learning applications. 
Unsupervised Learning is how we find patterns and structure in these data.

**Clustering** is the most well-known unsupervised learning technique.
It finds structure in unlabeled data by identifying similar groups, or clusters.
Examples of clustering applications are:
* **Recommendation engines**: group products to personalize the user experience
Search engines: group news topics and search results
Market segmentation: group customers based on geography, demography, and behaviors
Image segmentation: medical imaging or road scene segmentation on self-driving cars
