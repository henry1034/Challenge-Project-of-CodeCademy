# [Introduction to Multiple Linear Regression](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/machine-learning/lessons/multiple-linear-regression-streeteasy/exercises/introduction)
Linear regression is useful when we want to predict the values of a variable from its relationship with other variables.
There are two different types of linear regression models: 
* simple linear regression and 
* multiple linear regression

In predicting the price of a home, one factor to consider is the size of the home. 
The relationship between those two variables, price and size, is important, but there are other variables that factor in to pricing a home: 
location, air quality, demographics, parking, and more.
When making predictions for price, our dependent variable, we’ll want to use multiple independent variables. 
To do this, we’ll use Multiple Linear Regression. 
**Multiple Linear Regression** uses two or more independent variables to predict the values of the dependent variable.
It is based on the following equation:
### y = b + m<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>
